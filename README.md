# JayaLearn

A modern, full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) built for small-scale tutorials and tuition classes. This project was created for my mom, Jayashree, who is a passionate teacher running her own home-based tutorial. The LMS streamlines her workflow, helping her manage batches, students, homework, notices, and more—all in one place.
